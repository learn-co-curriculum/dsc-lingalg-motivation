    "# Motivation for Linear Algebra in Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Algebra & Statistics are founding steps for data science & machine learning. Machine learning is as much about linear algebra, probability theory and statistics (especially graphical models) and information theory as much as data analysis. In this section of the course, we will focus at Linear Algebra, which is a pre-requisite for almost any technical field of knowledge today in about any technical discipline, including computer science and data science.  This lesson attempts to present a quick motivation on how and why linear algebra is a valuable skills for data analysts.\n",

    "## Background \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Algebra is a continuous form of mathematics and is applied throughout science and engineering because it allows you to model natural phenomena and to compute them efficiently. Because it is a form of continuous and not discrete mathematics, a lot of computer scientists don't have a lot of experience with it. Linear Algebra is also central to almost all areas of mathematics like geometry and functional analysis. Its concepts are a crucial prerequisite for understanding the theory behind Data Science. You don't need to understand Linear Algebra before getting started in Data Science, but at some point, you may want to gain a better understanding of how the different Machine Learning algorithms really work under the hood. So if you really want to be a professional in this field, you will have to master the parts of Linear Algebra that are important for Machine Learning.\n",

    "You might already know a number of linear algebraic concepts and operations like matrix multiplication, calculating determinants, cross-products and eigenvectors/eigenvalues etc (don't worry if you don't, we will cover these in the course). As a data scientist, it is imperative that you carry a theoretic, as well as a practical understanding of these and other similar concepts alongside their applications in real world problem solving. \n",
    "\n",
    "### An Analogy \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a simple example where you first learn about a `sine` function as an infinite polynomial while learning trigonometry. Students normally practice this function by passing different values to it and getting the expected results, and manage to relate this to triangles and vertices. When learning advanced physics, students get to learn more applications of sine and other similar functions in the area of sound and light. In the domain of Signal Processing for 1D data, these functions pop up again to help you solve filtering, time-series related problems. An introduction to numeric computation around sine functions can not alone help you understand its wider application areas. In fact sine functions are everywhere in the universe from music to light/sound/radio waves, from pendulum oscillations to alternating current. \n"

    "## Why Linear Algebra?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning vector spaces and linear relationships between such spaces. It includes the study of lines, planes, and subspace, but is also concerned with properties common to all vector spaces.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogous to the example we saw above, It is important that a data scientist understands how data structures are built with vectors and matrices following the geometric intuitions that are from linear algebra, in addition to the numeric calculations. Such data-focused understanding of linear algebra is what let's machine learning practitioners decide what tools can be applied to a given problem, how to interpret the results of experiments, whereas a numeric understanding helps towards the applications of these tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good understanding of Linear Algebra is necessary to analyze ML/AI algorithms, especially for Deep Learning where so much happens behind the scenes.  "

    "\n",
    "So we know that computers are designed to process binary information only, i.e. only 0s and 1s. So how can an image such as Einstein's face above with multiple attributes like color be stored in a computer? This is achieved by storing the pixel intensities for red, blue and green colors in a matrix format. Color intensities can be coded into this matrix and can be processed further for analysis and enhancement related tasks. So any operation which we perform on this image would likely use Linear Algebra with matrices at the back end."

That is, it could be a 1-D matrix (a vector is actually such a tensor),a 2-D matrix (like a data frame), a 3-D matrix (something like a cube of numbers), even a 0-D matrix (a single number), or a higher dimensional structure that is harder to visualize.\n",

A tensor encapsulates the scalar, vector and the matrix characteristics. For deep learning, creating and processing tensors and operations that are performed on these also require knowledge of linear algebra. "
